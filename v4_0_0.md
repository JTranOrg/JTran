- <b>Remove all external dependencies</b>
    - Merged expression parser project back into main JTran project.
    - Created a new Json parser to replace external library.
        - The same parser parses the json data source and the jtran transform file.
    - JTran is now a single dll with no dependendencies on external NuGet packages.

- <b>Increased performance</b>
    - Mostly with the use of ICharacterSpan which replaces strings and is cached.
    - When the input data source is a POCO list then we can do shortcuts to retrieve data values during the transformation.
    - Replace use of ExpandoObject with a custom JsonObject.

- <b>Lower memory footprint</b>
    - ICharacterSpan reduces the amount of memory needed for the in-memory json model
    - Use of helper enumerable classes to do real time handling of arrays, e.g. where clauses, joins, etc. This means not having to create a whole new array in memory to do a where filter, etc.
    - When the input json file is an array (starts with "[") the parsing is deferred and only parsed one item at a time (and then disposed). This allows very large json files to be transformed without needing to parse the entire json model into memory.

- <b>Refactoring</b>
    - Several areas were refactored to support all the other bullet items and just to simplify things. 

- <b>New features</b>
    - Functions
        - <b>union</b> - (New) Appends two arrays together
        - <b>join</b> - (New) Joins a list of strings together
        - <b>guid</b> - (New) Generates a guid
    - Elements
        - <b>#innerjoin</b> - (New) Create a single array from two arrays by matching objects from each array. Only objects that matched are included.
        - <b>#outerjoin</b> - (New) Create a single array from two arrays by matching objects from each array. All objects from the "left" array are included regardless if there is a matching object on the "right".
        - <b>#include</b> - (New) Filters an object to only output the given list of properties.
        - <b>#exclude</b> - (New) Filters an object to excluded given list of properties.
        - <b>#foreachgroup</b> - Now supports grouping on multiple fields.
        - <b>#calltemplate</b> - Now supports a simplified syntax, e.g. instead of #calltemplate(mytemplate) you can use #mytemplate.
        - <b>#iif</b> - Now supported as an element in addition to a function. Operates the same as a tertiary operator.
        - <b>#iterate</b> - Outputs an array by iterating a given number of times. Useful for creating sample data (in conjunction the the Random library).
    - Other
        - JTran can load a json array (starts with "[").
        - JTran can now output a json array.
        - Add support for // comments.

- <b>Bug Fixes</b>
    - Operator Precedence - Some operators were interpreted in serial order that should have had equal precedence, e.g. +/-. Lots of unit tests added to ensure correctness.
    - Line numbers in exceptions - Line numbers are now correctly reported in exceptions while parsing both the json data source and the jtran transform file.

- <b>Testing</b>
    - Created a new unit test project: JTran.Transform.UnitTests. All unit tests that actually test transforms will be moved there (still a work in progress).
    - Created the ROTA test project. ROTA is a fictional logistics company. The idea is to provide real-world tests and samples on how to use JTran (also a work in progress).
    - Created a test project for loading and transforing data from a Mongo DB.
    - Added a couple of projects for testing performance.

- <b>New Projects</b>
    - Added new helper library for creating random output. This is used as a JTran extension library and is useful for generating sample data. Is a separate NuGet package: JTran.Random.
